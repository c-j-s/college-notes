## Other Random variables

* **Geometric(p)** # of trials for first success
* **Negative Binomial(r, p)** # .... first r successes
* **Hyper Greometric(m, N, n)** # of marked balls selectected (**without
  Replacement) from a total of N
  total in a sample size of $n$ (m = total number of marked balls)

  $P{X=i} = \frac { \binom m i \binom {n - m} { n -i } } { \binom {N n } } 

  For $N \to \infty$, $\frac m N$ is nearly constant, this approaches binomial.

  $E[X] = \frac { nm } N$ 

Read derivation of $E[X]$ and $\text{Var}[X]$ for each.

## Sums of random variables

Expectation is linear: $E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b$

Prop: 9.2 $E[sum X_i] = \sum E[X_i]$

Cor: 9.2: In general, if $X_1, X_2 \cdots X_n$ are random variables,
$$ E[a_1 X_1 + \cdots a_n X_n + c ] = \sum E[X_i] $$
