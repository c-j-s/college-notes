Not commutative (hmmm... but this is associative....):

    Config + Config -> config

      { times = 1, input = stdin, munge = no }
    + { times = 2, input =      , munge =    } 
    = { times = 2, input = stdin, munge = no } 

Has identity:    

      { times = 1, input = stdin, munge = no }
    + { times =  , input =      , munge =    } 
    = { times = 1, input = stdin, munge = no } 

let e = { times =  , input =      , munge =    } 
    then e + x = x

Can you have a single operation with different identites?

equivalance relations:

    * transitive
    * reflexive
    * symmetric

Order relations:

    * Anti-symmetric: A ⇐ B and B ⇐ A => A = B
    * Reflexive: A ⇐ A
    * 

Poset don't have a totalling ordering

Huh. Never heard or pre-orders before
