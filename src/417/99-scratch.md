ex if $n \ge 2$ be a natural number. AN element $[a] \in \mathbb Z_n$ has a
mulitplicative inverse if and only if $a% is relatively prime to $n$

If $a$ is relatviely prime to $n$,
then $\exists s, t \in \mathbb N: as + nt = 1$   
then $as \equiv 1$ and $s$ is the inverse of $a$

inverse exists: $as \equiv 1 \mod n$  
$as + nt = 1 \forall t \in \mathbb N$
